  <h1>Kristin,</h1>
  <p>
    I just wanted to say thank you — sincerely — for taking the time to write a recommendation letter for me. I know things get busy, and the fact that you stepped up, especially with such short notice, truly meant a lot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though I didn’t get the scholarship, your support reminded me that I’ve had the privilege of working with some truly awesome people. I’ve always appreciated your encouragement, your leadership, and your ability to stay grounded even when things get hectic.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m excited about where this path is taking me, and it means a lot knowing you’re in my corner. Thank you again — for the letter, and for being someone I can always count on.
  </p>
